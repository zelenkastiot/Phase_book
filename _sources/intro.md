Welcome to an interactive Jupyter Book for the Magnetic Resonance in Medicine paper by Nan‐kuei Chen et al. entitled "[*The use of Fourier-domain analyses for unwrapping phase images of low SNR*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mrm.27719)".
It reports a new postprocessing procedure that uses Fourier‐domain data analyses to improve the accuracy and reliability of phase unwrapping for MRI data of low SNR.

This Jupyter Book lets you interact with a [demo of their code](https://github.com/nankueichen/Fourier_space_phase_unwrapping) to test their phase unwrapping method. You can change the code by inline on the pages or launch a MyBinder session to run your code in a Jupyter Notebook in another tab. The figures are made interactive using [Plotly](https://plotly.com). 

All of the code is contained inside one Jupyter notebook that uses [SoS](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/running.html#content) (Script of Scripts) workflow to enable communication between Julia and Python kernels.
