According to the shift theorem, the Fourier transform ($FT$)
of complex‐valued signals $\rho(x)$ that originate from an imagedomain
region will be shifted (by Δk) when there exists an
image‐domain phase gradient $(exp (i2\pi \Delta kx))$, as shown in
Equation 1, where $S(k_x)$ is the Fourier transform of $\rho(x)$, that
is, $S(k_x)=FT \;[\rho (x)]$:

$$
  S(k_{x} - \Delta k) = FT \;[ \rho (x) exp \;(i2 \pi \Delta kx) ] 
  \tag{1}
$$

The Fourier‐domain data corresponding to the imagedomain
data of Figure 1A and B are shown in blue line (peaked
at $k_x = 8$) and black line (peaked at $k_x = −22$), respectively,
in Figure 1C. Figure 1A to C illustrate that image‐domain
phase gradients can be computed with either image‐domain
analyses (after spatially unwrapping the phase values shown
in Figure 1A and B) or Fourier‐domain energy peak identification
(in Figure 1C) in the absence of noise.
